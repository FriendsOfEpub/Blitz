# Blitz Labs

This is the place where we review new and experimental features. 

An ePub 3.0.1 file is provided in order to test them in Reading Systems. 

The file is systematically tested on Reading Systems listed in the repo’s Readme.

Those features might be implemented in Blitz v.1 or v.2. It depends on many factors (LESS’ bloat, unexpected bugs outside official RS support list, etc.) so there is no guarantee we will implement all of them.

## Current features being tested

- `@supports` for progressive enhancement;
- `initial-letter` for drop-caps;
- custom `list-style-type` with fallback;
- flexbox to align elements vertically on title-page (alternative to `display: table` which proves problematic in legacy RMSDK).

## Features which may be tested and added

- Open type features
- CSS shapes
- CSS masking
